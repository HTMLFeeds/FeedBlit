# How HTML Feeds Compare with...

## IndieWeb

IndieWeb is more of a general concept of independent ownership of the web than a prescription for a specific set of technologies to achieve this. HTML Feeds is more the prescription, and is generally aligned with the ideals of IndieWeb.

## RSS

Both HTML Feeds and RSS share the same general idea of being able to operate entirely from static web hosting. However, the similarities end there. RSS was an epic failure for a multitude of reasons, but most notably because it effectively tried to re-invent the web with a weak XML-based design. By contrast, HTML Feeds don't re-invent anything. It's just a way of using what already works––HTML and CSS.

## Nostr

Nostr isn't so much of a social media protocol as it is a way to store small bits of data (< 64kb) on remote servers (called "relays"), and perform basic query operations on that data. It doesn't address the problem of mass distribution of large media (images, videos), and most nostr clients defer the responsibility and encourage a self-hosted approach, which is the central idea of HTML Feeds. The nostr community is vibrant and growing, and it's possible that future media distribution apps could rely on both HTML Feeds and nostr for different features.
